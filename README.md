# Classification Assignment

## Overview
This project uses the **Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn** dataset to perform classification analysis.
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Classification.ipynb`) that focuses on classification analysis. The notebook explores various classification techniques to analyze and predict categorical outcomes based on given datasets. Through this assignment, users will gain hands-on experience with different classification models, evaluating their performance and interpreting results effectively.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of Classification Models
- Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics
- Visualization of Results

## Activities and Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, removing outliers)
- Data Transformation (normalization, feature encoding)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation analysis, data visualization)
- Classification Techniques (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Dependencies
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook using:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Classification.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells in order to preprocess the data, build classification models, and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset Used
The dataset used in this project is **Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn**. It contains various features that help in classifying categorical outcomes. The dataset is preprocessed and analyzed before applying classification models.

## Expected Output
The notebook will generate:
- Summary statistics of the dataset
- Graphs and plots for data visualization
- Classification model outputs and performance metrics

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive introduction to classification analysis, helping users understand and apply various classification models in real-world scenarios. By completing this assignment, users will enhance their data science skills and improve their ability to interpret classification results effectively.
